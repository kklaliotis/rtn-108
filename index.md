# CCD Height Effects on Rubin PSFs

```{abstract}
Modeling the point-spread function (PSF) precisely is essential for many-- if not all-- science cases with the Rubin Observatory. In this work, we inspect a PSF residual pattern present in both Rubin's ComCam and LSSTCam observations. We show that it is likely due to effects from CCD non-flatness, and elaborate on the mechanism by which height offsets could influence the PSF. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating height information into PSF modeling greatly reduces the observed residual.

### 1.1 Overview

_Under Construction_

### 1.2 PSF Characterization

Synthetic magnitudes were derived by integrating spectrophotometric spectra from the Pickles Stellar Spectra Library {cite}`1998PASP..110..863P` with filter passband transmission curves for DES and LSST. These magnitudes were calculated using broad-band absolute magnitude definitions and processed using a Python-based fitting code to generate transformation equations. Due to the limited number of stars in the Pickles library (~100), the resulting plots are sparse but provide a consistent reference.
